    <p id='home_about_message'>Mile High Bibliophiles is a book club unlike other book clubs.  We are a book club of diversity, inclusivity and warmth.  We choose each book by vote - every member bringing their own pick and pitching it to the group.  We strive to move thoughtfully and slowly through each of our reads, so as to allow a full bloom of conversation to develop.  We are a group of friends and a community who value a little drink, a little food and a lot of fun and reading.</p>
